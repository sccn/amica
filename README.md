# The AMICA algorithm and EEGLAB plugin

Adaptive Mixture Independent Component Analysis (AMICA) is a program (for Linux, Mac, and Windows) that performs an independent component analysis (ICA) decomposition on input data, potentially with multiple ICA models. It can be run standalone, or from MATLAB.

Code for AMICA: Adaptive Mixture ICA with shared component

Refer to the [Amica wiki](https://github.com/japalmer29/amica/wiki) for documentation or the other menus if you are on the EEGLAB website.
